Known issues:
------------

	PEEL:
		- phantom support is busted
		- can't disable more than 12 engines (since keyboards only have F1 -> F12 keys)
		- some convex objects are not rendered when the ICE convex hull code fails
		- some "add objects" tests include in their timings the cost of creating render objects. That's not good.
		And sometimes it also includes the cost of the PEEL plugins trying to share shapes, rather than the cost
		of the physics engine itself. This part needs some more work.
		
	Bullet:
		- ragdoll's joints are not properly setup. It works in other engines, no idea what I'm doing wrong.
		- "convex stack 2" explodes, even with a small margin. No other engine does that so I'm sure the input data is ok. Not sure how to fix it.
		- empty static scene perf is still a problem despite Erwin's feedback.

	Havok:
		- triangles are not backface culled in raytracing tests, producing slightly unfair comparisons.
		How do we enable backface culling there?
		- memory usage might be incorrectly captured. Not entirely sure what's the proper way.
		- Voronoi fracture scene acts very strangely in newer Havok versions, although the same scene & setup code works fine in older versions.

	Newton:
		- can't use 3.9 and 3.13 PEEL plugins at the same time. We should try delay loading.
		- sleeping is not deactivated
		- ragdoll/ragdoll collision filtering does not work
		- deleting an object is not implemented, so the Voronoi fracture scene isn't properly setup.

TODO:
----

	PEEL:
		- revisit "add objects" scenes. Ideally we'd rely on the plugins themselves to record & report the time spent in the physics engine.
		Or we need specialized virtual calls to do "batch adds" at runtime, while all the necessary data has been computed before (not timed).
		- the 'SQ Profiling Mode' stuff is confusing. It would be better to replace the 'ProfileUpdate' function with just something
		defining the preferred profiling mode for each test, while still leaving the option to override this with the UI parameter.
		- better test scenes for actors insertion, e.g. 10000 adds while the scene already has 30K objects.
		- add proper "mesh cooking" benchmarks
		- add more convex sweeps scenes
		- add support for heightfields (all engines)
		- add support for aggregates (PhysX. Find equivalent in other engines.)
			- this should improve performance of ragdoll scenes quite a bit (at least for PhysX)
		- add support for character controllers. Probably quite hard to do.
		- add support for vehicles. Probably even harder.
		- share rendering objects between engines. This is done in very few tests, but it should be done everywhere.

	Bullet:
		- support overlaps
		- support multithreading
		- support 'raycast any' and 'raycast all'

	Havok:
		- support box overlaps
		- support capsule overlaps
		- support 'raycast any' and 'raycast all'

	Newton:
		- complete PINT plugin (sweeps, overlaps, raycast any, CCD, disable sleeping, etc, etc).

	PhysX:
		- support for convex sweeps is not implemented for all versions. Complete this.

	All engines:
		- there's a lot of common code to refactor in all the different PINT plugins
